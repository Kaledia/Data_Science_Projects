Data visualisation with Tableau on a data about the sales of video games. 
Created 3 graphs and made a dashboard with them. The first graph is a linear representation of global sales vs year with the genre as label and filter by platform. The second graph is a histogram of global sales vs genres with a descending sorting. The last graph is a linear comparison of Japan and North America sales against the years.
